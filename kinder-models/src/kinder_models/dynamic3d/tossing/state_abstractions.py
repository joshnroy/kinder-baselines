"""State abstractions for the Tossing3D environment.

MovableIsDownX records that one movable is at lower x than another -- in practice which
side of cuboid_barrier (x ~ 1.3) a cube is on, so an operator model can express that a
toss past it is irreversible.

TODO: only Tossing3D-o1 is supported; no operator says which cube a throw is aimed at.
