# identity is a defect rather than a convenience: MoveToThrowPose's only add effect is
# RobotAtThrowPose, so a predicate accepting every standoff the sampler can draw is an
# add effect satisfied by construction on every attempt. Downstream, hitl-pmp measured
# what that costs on its port of this domain -- 16/16 attempts labelled success against
# 0/16 informed draws, versus 7/20 informed for a pick skill in the same run -- because

# geometry on every call and stays correct when the bin or the goal region moves.
#
# Calibrated downstream in hitl-pmp, against where success breaks rather than in free
# flight, and the difference is a trap: throwing onto open floor and recording where the
# cube comes to rest gives 1.3499 m (sd 0.0024, n = 12), which is ~0.075 m longer
# because it includes post-impact roll. The goal-region test needs the *impact* range,
# since a cube landing inside the region is caught by the bin rather than rolling on.
# Two independent sweeps bracket the impact range to (1.2608, 1.3090) and, from the two
# edges of partial solving independently, to 1.2749 from each end.
#
# That calibration was taken with the gripper opening on the first control step past
# release fraction 0.46, which is exactly what TossController does, so it describes this
# controller rather than approximating it.

# **The band is the region's own edges, untrimmed, and the trimming a downstream port
# applies is deliberately not copied here.** hitl-pmp narrows this box by two margins it
# measured (0.025 m and 0.05 m), because a 5-seed sweep found the standoffs solving on
# every seed to be narrower than the geometric prediction at both ends. Those margins
# were measured against its own hand-composed throw and indexed by *commanded* standoff,
# and commanded standoff is not what this predicate reads: driving move_to_target to a
# commanded 1.35 m leaves the base 1.3778 m from the bin, 27.8 mm short, well inside
# WAYPOINT_TOLERANCE but a third of the width either margin would trim. Transplanting
# them would import a 28 mm indexing error along with the measurement.
#
# The untrimmed band is already what fixes the defect: it is derived from the scored
# region rather than from the sampler's range, so the add effect can fail. A consumer
# with its own reliability measurement can pass an already-trimmed box.

# Wider than WAYPOINT_TOLERANCE: the sampler already spends half of it off-axis.
